Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
- UDP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
- TCP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
- UDP port 21 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
- TCP port 21 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
- S3 buckets lack server-side encryption and logging is not enabled
- Security Group allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
- Security Group allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- Edit the Security Group to remove access from internet on port 21, 23
- Provide specific IP address range for Security Group ingress on port 22
- Remove unrestricted access to port 3389
- Enable server side encryption for S3
- Enable S3 logging
